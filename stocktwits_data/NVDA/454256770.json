Hedgefunds are doing a tremendous job killing retail sentiment.  I am a tough nut to crack.  A few more sessions like this week though and I might be ready to cash out.  Do they realize that their corruption will only serve to fuc$ them in the end?  Millions of retail investors entering the market benefits them by driving up market caps.  Running off all the little people with their short sales will only minimize the strength of the next bull run when there is less money and volume in the markets. Take your feet off our throats for at least a week or two.  Hedgefunds will have only themselves to blame when the market tanks and doesn\u2019t pop back like it did in 2020.
