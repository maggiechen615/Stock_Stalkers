In hindsight NVDA short from market open would\u2019ve been a \ud83d\udd25 play. The rest was scalps for less than $100. In hindsight I wish I held the HUSA short because it alone would\u2019ve made me 1.4k with 2k shares \ud83d\ude05. I expected it to go down all day when the INDO run didn\u2019t happen however I was feeling like I should secure some gains ($200) in case it bounces and I get stopped out with little gains. I was feeling I should secure profits mainly because it was a slow day and I only had $150 in profits at that point in the day. Had it been near the end of the day I would\u2019ve easily held a lot longer. Met the $500 goal for the day. Hoping to finish the week green tomorrow\ud83e\udd1e. Hope you all banked today.
