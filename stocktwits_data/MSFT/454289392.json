Result, $ATVI falls back down to it&#39;s original levels, leaving shareholders bagholding. How does one avoid this? You would need to make sure your stop loss is on in the pre-market and after hours market every day (before and after the bell).

Risk play, $2100 dollar investment should see gains just over $500 if the deal goes through. Sell close to $500 dollars worth, and you should see a value of $2100 of MSFT in your brokerage account.
