Allen suggested the name, which was short for micro-computer software. \n  \nThe pair\u2019s initial work was to program the Altair 8800 microcomputer. They then began developing operating systems, getting a contract from IBM for its personal computer in 1980. Five years later, the company introduced Microsoft Windows, which became the dominant operating system for personal computers to this day.  \n  \nThe success of Microsoft made both Gates and Allen multi-billionaires, and Gates held the title of world\u2019s richest person for several years before he began giving his fortune away. The company they founded is one of the most valuable in the world, with a market capitalization of more than two trillion dollars.  \n  \nSource: Microsoft; Doug Wilson / Getty Images", "time": 1649107762.0, "sentiment": "Bullish"}, {"id": 449675496, "text": "@SwaggyJ505 \u201coh shit.
