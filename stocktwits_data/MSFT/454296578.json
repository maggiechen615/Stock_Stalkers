It is my one year anniversary since I started my site and helping both investors and traders navigate through some of our most challenging mkts. \n\nAnd how fitting an anniversary as we get set for arguably the most important week this year - the &quot;Generals&quot; (AMZN,  TSLA,  MSFT,  AAPL. FB) are all on deck and them along with the PCE data will be crucial in determining our mkt direction for the foreseeable future. \n\nWhat I do takes enormous amount of time and effort. To provide  accurate content each and every day so as to have an educational platform for you all to learn from has been a passion of mine and I look forward to another year ahead. \n\nThank you all! \n\njessielivermore1929@gmail.com", "time": 1650753381.0, "sentiment": ""}, {"id": 454304566, "text": "@TheVulcanDevilWhale  I don&#39;t like  how $MSFT looks like", "time": 1650753341.0, "sentiment": ""}, {"id": 454303762, "text": "Apple, Amazon, Microsoft headline busy earnings week ahead https://www.billionaireclubcollc.com/apple-amazon-microsoft-headline-busy-earnings-week-ahead/ $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT", "time": 1650752736.0, "sentiment": ""}, {"id": 454303693, "text": "$MSFT  rate hikes don&#39;t always equate to horrible news for the overall market https://youtu.be/ePBe3zNy50A", "time": 1650752690.0, "sentiment": "Bullish"}, {"id": 454303658, "text": "$msft  .", "time": 1650752672.0, "sentiment": ""}, {"id": 454303527, "text": "Tesla Motors, Inc.
