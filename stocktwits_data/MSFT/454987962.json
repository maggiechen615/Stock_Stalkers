I&#39;ve been big on energy and fertilizer names for months  - those have been gems. We will get a rotation back into tech  -  it will come. And there are a basket of gems there as well. Most importantly, this mkt takes patience. A virtue few traders have.  Stocks in this mkt aren&#39;t getting away  - so I don&#39;t need to try and catch a knife.
