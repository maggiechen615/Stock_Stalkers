It\u2019s earnings season which means they can get away with pumping the bubble up much bigger because of cooked books like Amazon with Rivian. I see days of rallying even though the economic data and consumer doesn\u2019t support a bull market WHATSOEVER. Corporations like Apple are sitting on piles of cash thanks to the Feds QE that paid them billions for their corporate bonds. I fully expect buy backs to also happen at the same time pushing stocks higher. We could very well see S&amp;P500 hit a new ATH, even the Dow. But after all the euphoria, the chickens will come home to roost and we\u2019ll me shouting Mayday, mayday, mayday. The only thing that remains now is you: when will you get out? Will greed set in and cause losses because you expect it to continue upward in a time of fiscal tightening? Use logic. This bubble is quickly coming towards a needle point. Again I say...
