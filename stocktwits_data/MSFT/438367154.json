Until QE ends in March, do not expect a real sell off. In fact, today&#39;s 12PM rally is just all QE manipulation which we commonly call the Plunge Protection Team. A side note, the situation in Ukraine is far more tense than people realize because the issue isn&#39;t about America fighting Russia, but rather Ukrainian military starting skirmishes directly with Russian military armed by the US which would be a spark in dry tinder. The conflict would escalate very fast. But, these recent market sell offs have little to do with Russia as it is with the US economic data which was on average far worse than expected, Fed rate hikes and tapering. I see a bear market starting, than the Fed reversing on their course, cutting rates, doubling on QE... and that my friends will be the beginning of hyper inflation and end the US economy and US dollar.
