I can respect that. It isn&#39;t for everyone. However, I will say this. If you are trying to make a living as a professional trader/investor, you HAVE to know how to short stocks. It isn&#39;t easy and the risk is heavier, but it is a tool you have to have in your bag. \n\nWe have a huge week ahead. Big cap tech. PCE data. Mkt technicals being tested.
