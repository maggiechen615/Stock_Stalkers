I discuss where I believe mkts are headed as well as a breakdown of all the key earnings. I discuss the big cap tech names and which ones I would still avoid and which I like. Am I still bearish on the mkt as I&#39;ve been since the first week of January? I am. But to what levels? \n\nThose who want to join, email me at jessielivermore1929@gmail.com \n\nFinally, a quick tip .... I recently heard from a member who said he doesn&#39;t short stocks/mkt. I can respect that. It isn&#39;t for everyone. However, I will say this. If you are trying to make a living as a professional trader/investor, you HAVE to know how to short stocks. It isn&#39;t easy and the risk is heavier, but it is a tool you have to have in your bag. \n\nWe have a huge week ahead. Big cap tech. PCE data. Mkt technicals being tested. Strap on both seatbelts we are headed for some massive moves. \u270c\ufe0f", "time": 1650836367.0, "sentiment": ""}, {"id": 454377133, "text": "$MSFT elon never said he had beef with micro penis.
