He already annexed Crimea in 2014 and Obama did nothing. He knows that we don\u2019t have the appetite for war and that after abandoning our Afghan allies last year it will look horrible for anyone relying on American security (Taiwan anyone?) when we also abandon our Ukrainian allies. I also have very little doubt that China supports a Russian invasion 100% because it weakens Taiwan as well.
