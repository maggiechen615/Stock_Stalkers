And it hasn&#39;t been easy to remain in that camp  - not when the &quot;experts&quot; on CNBC  continously tout how bullish they are.  Not when we have 150 handle rallies in just three days. But I&#39;ve been in multiple bear mkts and that is exactly the type of action you get. \n\nMy Game Plan for next week  goes out on Sunday and it may be my most important one yet (email me at jessielivermore1929@gmail.com if you want to join). \n\nWhy so important? Because next week is one of the most important weeks this mkt has had in years. Big cap tech earnings are going to create a massive selloff or a relief bounce. PCE is going to spark future fear or a calming effect.
