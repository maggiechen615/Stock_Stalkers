[{"id": 453807652, "text": "$SPY $AMD $NVDA $U  Anyone convinced that the market will always just go up and to the right because the company is real regardless of valuation, you should look at a 25 year chart of $CSCO as seen below. It can take a loooong time to get back to highs when a company gets out of bubble territory, matures, and the hype fades.\n\nAll this metaverse, omniverse, etc nonsense is very reminiscent of the talk in the early days of the internet. Was it the future? Absolutely. Literally the backbone of the internet! Was it a great stock at the moment during the hype and talk? Absolutely not. \n\nObviously you can&#39;t compare this directly as the dotcom bubble saw multiples that were completely insane. But the covid bubble hasn&#39;t been exactly sane either.\n\nMacro investing sucks. It makes you consider things outside the fundamnetals  of the company. But it can be very real and have a very powerful impact on your returns.
