If it breaks that bottom support though all bets are off. So I&#39;m waiting and being patient. \n \nSome of this might still be a bit early. I&#39;m not convinced the selling pressure is exhausted yet but I think we&#39;re getting close. When energy/commodities roll over and growth starts moving up you&#39;ll know the rotation is happening.
